# Query Kit Fork

This library is a fork from an upstream library. Meaning:

- All changes should be made with the intention of making it easy to merge in upstream stranges.
- Keep large changes in separate files and wrap changes in methods as much as possible.
- Provide good descriptions of the before and after changes in the comments, so it's clear what changed.
